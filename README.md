# AI Models for GRC Engineering: Translating NIST 800-53 Into AWS Evidence

Demonstrating how AI models can translate compliance controls into actionable cloud evidence.

## About This Project

This project demonstrates how GRC engineering can leverage AI reasoning models and Python automation to bridge the gap between regulatory frameworks and cloud infrastructure.

By using the **HackIDLE-NIST-Coder** model through **Ollama**, NIST SP 800-53 controls are interpreted and transformed into executable Python code that retrieves real-time compliance evidence from AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).

The result is a practical example of control automation specifically aligned with NIST AC-2 (Account Management) that shows how AI can operationalize compliance validation, reduce manual audit workload, and increase transparency between GRC teams and cloud environments.

## Tools & Setup

This project uses a combination of AI, Python automation, and AWS services to translate regulatory controls into actionable cloud evidence. Each component is chosen to support GRC engineering principles, control validation, and audit readiness.

| Tool / Component                             | Purpose & Value                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ollama (AI engine/runtime)**               | Hosts and executes AI models locally, providing a secure environment for compliance queries.            |
| **HackIDLE-NIST-Coder**                      | AI model fine-tuned on NIST cybersecurity frameworks; generates Python scripts aligned with compliance controls. |
| **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** | Source of cloud account data, used to verify access controls and account lifecycle management.          |
| **Python + boto3**                           | Enables programmatic interaction with AWS APIs for real-time evidence collection and automation.        |

## Step-by-Step Setup

1. Install Ollama
Ollama is a local AI engine that allows you to run models securely on your machine.
Follow the instructions for your operating system: https://ollama.com/download

2. Pull and run the AI model locally
```bash
ollama pull etgohome/hackidle-nist-coder
ollama run etgohome/hackidle-nist-coder
```
Example prompt inside Ollama:
```pgsql
>>> Generate a Python script using boto3 to list AWS IAM users.
>>> Include comments linking the purpose to NIST 800-53 AC-2 (Account Management).
```

3. Save the generated script locally
```bash
mkdir grc-iam-list-users
cd grc-iam-list-users
nano iam_list_users.py
```

Paste the Python code generated by the AI model into iam_list_users.py and save it.

4. Configure your AWS credentials

```bash
aws configure sso
```

Verify your credentials:
```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity --profile profilename
```

5. Run the script
```bash
python iam_list_users.py --profile profilename
```

Optional details mode:
```
python iam_list_users.py --profile profilename --details
```

## Example Output

When the script runs successfully, it produces a list of IAM users in your AWS account. Example:
```yaml
List of IAM Users:
annie.crane | ID: AIDAV2H00TS0BOJID0002 | ARN: arn:aws:iam::300066700000:user/annie.crane | Created: 2025-09-11 02:21:42
john.don   | ID: AIDAV2H00TS0BOJID0003 | ARN: arn:aws:iam::300066700000:user/john.don   | Created: 2025-09-10 14:17:09
...

This output provides real-time evidence of user accounts, supporting audits and control validation.

## NIST SP 800-53 Linkage

The script directly aligns with NIST AC-2 (Account Management).

| Control  | Title              | Purpose                                                       | How This Script Helps                                   |
| -------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AC-2** | Account Management | Ensure accounts are created, managed, and removed per policy. | Lists all IAM users for visibility and control testing. |

> This approach demonstrates how AI-assisted automation can operationalize regulatory controls into actionable cloud evidence.

## GRC Insights

This project illustrates how GRC professionals can leverage AI and automation without becoming full-time developers:

- Speak the language of the cloud: Ask questions like “Who are my users?” programmatically.
- Verify compliance automatically: Transform NIST SP 800-53 requirements into executable Python scripts.
- Reduce manual audit workload: Quickly generate evidence and reports for auditors.
- Bridge gaps between GRC and engineering: Use automation to improve visibility, transparency, and control effectiveness.

> The combination of AI reasoning models, Python automation, and AWS APIs allows organizations to move from policy interpretation to data-driven compliance validation.
